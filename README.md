FCC Test Challengs Prototype 
============================

QA with mocha & chai

Adapted to work via github
Fork the folder using the button to the top right
Then clone it using the command line
```
git clone https://github.com/<YOURNAME>/boilerplate-mochachai.git
```
Run 
```
npm install
```
To install the modules you need. Then run
```
npm test
```
to run the tests. They will all fail at first.
Only the files in the /tests/ folder need to be changed.
Get into the habit of committing each time you complete one of the tests.
Use the documentation at [The Chai Website](https://www.chaijs.com/api/assert/) or the answers on the answer branch if you get stuck.
