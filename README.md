FCC Test Challengs Prototype 
============================

QA with mocha & chai

Adapted to work via github
Fork the folder using the button to the top right
Then clone it using the command line
```
git clone https://github.com/<YOURNAME>/boilerplate-mochachai.git
```
Alternatively, you can import it into [repl.it](https://www.repl.it) using the *import repo* button on the top right.
In the terminal, run 
```
npm install
```
To install the modules you need. Then run
```
npm test
```
to run the tests. They will all fail at first.
Only the files in the /tests/ folder need to be changed.
Get into the habit of committing each time you complete one of the tests. You can do this with
``` 
git add .
git commit -m 'tests stage <NUMBER> passing'
git push
```
Use the documentation at [The Chai Website](https://www.chaijs.com/api/assert/) or the answers on the answer branch if you get stuck.
